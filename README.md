# 312project
design of a student course registration system (SCRS)


dear team members,
this is the best way to follow up with the project because Github is the start point.
 to make it clear for us on github:
  1. repository section is the main project table.
  2. branch is becalled A BRANCH FOR EVERY MEMBER (YOUR CODE PART TO WORK ON).
  3. commit is when you upload the code file and save it; you can attach a commit message to it (like a comment).
  4. pull request is the action to pull(take) the branch which you edited and MERGE IT TO THE (MASTER BRANCH; WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL CODE).
  
  //ABOUT THE PROJECT; SECTION.
  
      we will create an application (USRS) in which 4 actors may work on it at the same time (concurrently).
      **division of the project:
          1. student class (S)
          2. academic advisor (AA)
          3. vice chair (VC)

          5. system administrator (SA)
      //we will use date from our department/university websites.
      /* WE WILL USE JAVA LANGUAGE (ON ANY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT LIKE ECLIPSE OR NETBEANS). TOGETHER WITH SQL FOR TABLES DESIGN.*/
